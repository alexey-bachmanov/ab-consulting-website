# AB Biomedical consulting

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Multi-page SPA for a biomedical consulting company. This project was embarked on to upgrade my CSS and design skills from "garbage" to "kinda OK".

This project is deployed to Netlify. [Check it out](https://bachmanov-biomedical-consulting.netlify.app/).
